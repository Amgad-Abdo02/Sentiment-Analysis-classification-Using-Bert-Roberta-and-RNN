# Overview
Using the [IMDB Movie Reviews](https://ai.stanford.edu/~amaas/data/sentiment/) we FineTune pretrained BERT and RoBERTa for Sentiment Analysis on aforementioned Dataset, we applied both models on preprocessed text data and raw data to study the changes preprocessing has on models.
we also created our own RNN LSTM model and tried to train the data and apply the same experiement as the 2 pretrained LLMS
